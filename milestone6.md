*Ryan:* I implemented UI components to overlay the map in order to interact with the data points relevant to flights. There are now templated buttons and dropdowns for price, starting location, and how soon the slight might be. Waiting on the API integration to be able to tie these selections to real implications on the map. Still need to dynamically change the option being displayed based on what was picked. Also need to user test and see how people respond to the given options. I also did minor refactoring to clean up the main directory.
