4. Tour guide for people who don't want a tour guide. Triton Tour.

5. Looks for trails to walk around on campus.

6. Visualization of github commits around the world, sorting ability to see where people are working on projects similar to yours

7. Map of locations to recycle/properyly dispose of hazardous material and electronics like batteries, paint, medications, etc.

8. Integrating Google Maps and Yelp AP to simutaneously place relevant Yelp bookmarks on your route
