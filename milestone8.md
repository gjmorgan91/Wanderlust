The entire team drafted out 3 things:
1. The box that appears when you hover over a pin on the map
2. The "explore" screen when you want to learn more about a place you are considering traveling to
3. The "compare" screen where you can compare flight options

The underlying concept of my app was that the user never loses sight of the map, and that all screens appear as an overlay. In each overlay, the user has cards that appear with relevant info. On the explore screen, these cards are in 3 columns that pull data from other popular sites for hotel & food info. The compare is also an overlay with cards, similar to how Google Maps does listings.

The user starts on a page with different destination pins based on default filter settings which can be modified. Once they hover on a pin, they get to see the name of the city, a price for the round trip flight, and the date range of their trip. If they click "Buy", they are redirected to the airline website where their tickets will be added to a cart. If the user clicks "Explore", they see more information about the destination. If they click compare, a list will show up with information about all pins on the map similar to Google Maps.

The prototypes show you several different options for displaying information beyond the map/flight search functionality. To show users information about buying flight tickets and housing, we can link them to Skyscanner and AirBNB searches, or host them natively. On the last screen, when "Explore" is clicked, it pulls information from Google Places about popular places at the destination city.

My prototype shows how a user selects multiple pins on the map to bring up a compare option on the bottom of the travel list. The buttons brings the user to a new page which has the to destinations side by side. The header on the page will include all the information of the flight (airline, price, dates, any additional stops, time the flight takes, etc) and additional information about the destinations. From there the user has the option of returning to the search results, and proceeding to buy a flight.
