**Description of what each team member has done on the project so far**

_Ryan:_
Implemented Google Maps, prepared pins to take in an array of locations. Waiting for API implementation from rest of group to feed accurate data points.

_Sandra:_
Added code for geolocation within Google Maps, but need to integrate it with Ryan's marker implementation next. Researched flight and airport locating APIs-- decided on SkyScanner for flight information and Google Places for locating nearest airports.

_Yacoub:_
Set up an AWS app for us to deploy our project.

_Greg:_
Continued work on the UI elements and progression of the user from first navigating to the site up to looking for flights.

1) Shows how the site would first appear when navigating to it.

2) The prompt for the search mechanic that is the core element of the project, requiring users to input a budget and travel dates.

3) First point where the map becomes interactable. User is shown a visualization of their potential travel plans.

Considerations from the prototypes (to-do list):

Show how the user who signs into an existing account progresses

How a user can view all their saved trips

Expand on the visualization of the trips (embedding price and date information into their articulation)

How the interactions with the individual trip locations will work (pop-ups, sidebars, etc)
