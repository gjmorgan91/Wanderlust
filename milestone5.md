_Greg:_
Continued work on the UI elements and progression of the user from first navigating to the site up to looking for flights.

1) Shows how the site would first appear when navigating to it.

Considerations from the prototypes (to-do list):

Show how the user who signs into an existing account progresses

How a user can view all their saved trips

Expand on the visualization of the trips (embedding price and date information into their articulation)

How the interactions with the individual trip locations will work (pop-ups, sidebars, etc)
